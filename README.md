# raster

This is the source code for the R package "raster". Released versions are on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/raster/index.html)

To install the development version you can do:

`library(devtools)`

`install_github(rspatial/raster)`

If you are windows, you need to first install [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) to get a C++ compiler that R can use. 

If that is a problem, you may be able to get a recent version from [R-Forge](https://r-forge.r-project.org/R/?group_id=294) with this command `install.packages("raster", repos="http://R-Forge.R-project.org")`

On [rspatial.org](http://rspatial.org/) you can learn about spatial data analysis with R.
