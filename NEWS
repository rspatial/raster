Improved estimation of available RAM with contributions by Lorenzo Busetto. RAM available is now computed on windows, linux and mac. No more that 60% of available RAM is used (if the estimated RAM needed is not too low). Not more than raster:::.maxmemory() is used; but it should now be safe to set this to Inf. If canProcessInMemory() returns FALSE, chunksize is set 25% of available RAM, or raster:::.chunksize(), whichever is lower. (set options via rasterOptions())

reclass now has option 'right=NA' (apart from right=TRUE or right=FALSE) to allow intervals to be closed at the left and right side. It is now also possible to provide a two column relassification matrix ("is-becomes") (suggestions by Agustin Lobo). 

--- 12-October-2011, version 1.9-27
Functions re-implemented using C routines for better speed: focal (a combination of old functions focal, focalNA and focalFilter), distance, direction, reclass and slopeAspect.

option "useRaster" to plot. To use 'image' rather than 'rasterImage', because rasterImage not working on some platforms (windows server); in R versions above 2.13.0. The default is FALSE because 'image' is not working well in R 2.13.1 (it draws white lines over the image); but this was fixed in 2.13.1-patched and above.
Bug fix: new plot argument 'addfun' interfered with old argument 'add' such that 'add=T' did not work (reported by Achilleas Psomas)
Big speed gain (~50 times) for 'calc' with a RasterLayer. calc used apply(x, 1, fun) (which is more natural for RasterStackBrick objects), where it simply could use fun(x). This can now be tested using (currently undocumented) arguments forcefun=TRUE or forceapply=TRUE

--- 15-September-2011, version 1.9-13

Improved handling of multifile ncdf files & varname argument, suggested by Matt Fischer. 
cluster support for raster::predict function (run beginCluster() before using predict); but so far this seems to slow things down!

A warning is given when a rotated image is used (suggested by Agustin Lobo)
New function 'rectify' to unrotate rasters
Very limited initial support for rotated rasters (typically sat images). Many of the existing functions will work with these images, but results can be wrong. Should work OK for simple raster algebra etc. but probably not when joining data spatially.  Although basic extract with coordinates should work OK now.

It is also possible to do Arith & Math with mutliple RasterStackBrick objects (as long as nlayers is the same) and with a RasterStack/Brick and a RasterLayer objects.

Expanded sampleRandom by adding a 'cells' and 'extent' argument; 
Switched from RNetCDF to ncdf package for netcdf file support

unit='vector' ; to store the unit of the layer(s), e.g. "kg m-2 s-1"
zname='character' ; to store the name of the z (layers) variable, e.g. "time"
zvalue='vector' ; to store the values of the z variable, e.g. the dates corresponding to each later
These slots are now filled for values from netcdf files with "CF" type convention (e.g. cmip), with an attempt to covert "days since" to a Date (coverted to string).
Not yet used in writing, or with other formats
New clump function, now always using igraph (also for large rasters) & minor bug fix
